The interest rate is the amount a lender charges a borrower and is a percentage of the principalâ€”the amount loaned. The interest rate on a loan is typically noted on an annual basis known as the annual percentage rate (APR).

An interest rate can also apply to the amount earned at a bank or credit union from a savings account or certificate of deposit (CD). Annual percentage yield (APY) refers to the interest earned on these deposit accounts.
